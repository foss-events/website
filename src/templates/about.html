        // foss.events connects people via the most comprehensive collection of Free, Libre and/or Open Source Software events happening in Europe and online.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Our vision is to create a <a href="https://github.com/foss-events/website">Free Software/Open Source community calendar</a></strong>, with <a href="https://www.foss.events">www.foss.events</a> as an instance that is run by the community and for the community, a calendar that everyone can use, study, share and improve.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our calendar is <a href="/about.html#data">data-driven</a> and value-driven to help people finding events of their specific interests and favorites. Everyone can help with adding events or individual data on // foss.events. You can run your own version or find our values in <a href="/about.html#diversity">diversity</a> and our <a href="/about.html#criteria">criteria of selection</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In future, we envision // foss.events to not only help people finding their events but to also help people connecting at these events. People who would like to join an event should also be able to find car shares, flat welcomes, talk buddies and more. We believe in the power of connecting the right people at the right time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our software will always be Open Source/Free Software and shall be built with(in) connection to the fediverse. If you like our ideas, please <a href="/about.html#contributing">contribute</a>.

        If you know of an event that matches our <a href="#criteria">criteria</a> and you do not see it mentioned in our
        <a href="/">list of events</a>, please contribute:</p>

    <h4>Adding new events</h4>

    <p>
        If you are an organiser or you like to see your favorite event on // foss.events and you have 5 minutes of time, it would be of such a great help to this project if you can help us with adding useful information about an event. If you have trouble understanding our data set, check the <a href="#legend">legend</a> for
        explanation.
    </p>

    {% include 'partials/contribute-box.html' %}

    <p>
        Or, if you feel comfortable to send us the information about your event as a pull request, you can also edit the
        tab-separated csv-data file for each year of your event <a
            href="https://github.com/foss-events/website/tree/master/data" class="umami--click--aboutpage-contribgit">in /data/ on GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Also you are welcome to join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#foss.events:matrix.org">our Matrix community room</a> and talk / discuss any event there. 
    </p>

    <h4>Updating existing events</h4>

    <p>Often we add events before all details and information is available. If you see data missing or you have any sort of update to an event, please <a href="mailto:contact@foss.events">get in contact</a> and let us know.

        All event-data on // foss.events is <strong>collected by hand, or shared with us by the community</strong>. We
        try to regularly re-check the content on the site but in any case <strong>we guarantee neither completeness nor
        correctness of the data</strong> shown. In doubt, please confirm with the information given on the event's own
        website. If you find an inaccuracy on our site, please help to fix it <a
            href="#contributing">by contributing</a>. Find our criteria and legend below to understand our data-set:
    </p>


    <h3 id="criteria">about:criteria</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>One important part of // foss.events is to create and share the most comprehensive collection of Free, Libre and/or Open Source Software events in Europe and online</strong> (<a href="#diversity">read more</a> about what we understand as a FOSS event). That means we only list events that are happening in Europe or online but that are organised by an association or any group of people with their physical representation and cultural activity being in Europe.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We know that there is also a need for a similar calendar in other parts of the world and we will probably come up with versions that focus on other parts of the world in the future. But we have to focus on Europe as long as we are still developing the software and do not find the time to maintain an international list. And also we want to focus on one continent as we want to connect people beyond their events. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Valid "events" are all kinds of conferences and unconferences, hackmeetings, *-a-thons, camps, festivals,
        exhibitions and other kind of events - as long as they match the following criteria:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            only events that <strong>happen in Europe</strong> or online but are organised by a group of people / organisation in Europe.
        </li>
        <li>
            only events that are <strong>open for the general public</strong>. Entrance fee is ok, but events shall be
            accessible for everyone to participate and in particular not be restricted to a specific group like the
            members of a specific group, organisation or similar.
        </li>
        <li>
            only <strong>"full-day" events</strong>. As a rule of thumb, that means events that happen at least 6-8 hours or more.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you know about a Free, Libre and/or Open Source Software event in Europe that matches this criteria and is
        not yet in our list, please <a href="#contributing">contribute</a>.
    </p>

  <h3 id="diversity">about:diversity</h3>

    <p>
        There are reasons and arguments why some people prefer FOSS over FLOSS or vice versa, why some refer to Open
        Source and others to Free Software or Libre Software. And who knows, potentially in the next decade even a new
        term will be created ... (We heard sustainable software is an upcoming candidate.)
    </p>

    <p>
        At // foss.events we love this diversity. All these terms have their relevance and they allow us to put slightly
        different emphasis on the same technologies and ideals. Because apart from the actual naming and the details in
        the semantics, all these names technically refer to the same kind of software and sharing culture: Software that
        is published under a license that grants any user the 4 freedoms to use, study, share and improve the software
        without limitations. That is why on // foss.events we will not prefer one name over the other and in case we use
        one, it is representative to all the others.</p>

    <p>
        <strong> Unity in diversity: No matter the name, if your event is about the four freedoms of software your event
            is part of // foss.events!</strong>
    </p>
