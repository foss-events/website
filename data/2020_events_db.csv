Was 2002 in einem Karlsruher Kellerraum mit ein paar Technikbegeisterten angefangen hat, ist inzwischen zu einer der größten Veranstaltungen des Chaos Computer Clubs gewachsen. Die Themen sind breit gefächert: Den Kern bilden Hard- und Softwareentwicklung, sowie Datensicherheit. Daneben kommen aber auch Datenschutz, Netzpolitik und viele andere faszinierende Themen zum Zug: Wie kocht man das perfekte Gulasch? Kann man aus Hardwareschrott noch schönen Schmuck basteln? Wie funktioniert eigentlich eine Nähmaschine? Wie fliegt man Raumschiffe?

Mégapole aliénante, politiciens corrompus, révoltes sociales, expérimentations militaires, pouvoirs psychiques et mutations techno-organiques… Katsuhiro Otomo pose les bases du cyberpunk japonais et questionne avec acuité les modes d’organisation sociale, le rapport de l’homme à la technologie et sa place dans l’environnement.</p><p>La 10ème édition de la Toulouse HackerSpace Factory (THSF) se construit en hommage et écho à cette oeuvre majeure tant sur le plan graphique que scénaristique avec un récit profondément politique et social. Malheureusement la 2019 d’Otomo se rapproche par bien des aspects de notre 2019 actuelle, et les questions qu'il soulevait au début des années 80 restent toujours prégnantes. Notamment les inégalites et l'injustice sociale, le rapport à la science et aux technologies, aux contrôles des personnes et des masses, et à l’environnement. Autant de questions que, depuis 10 ans, la THSF entend partager avec des artistes, des hackers, des chercheurs, des militants associatifs et tous les publics.</p>							?
